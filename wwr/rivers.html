                <h2>Onon River</h2>
                <h3>The Onon River is the first tributary of the Black River, which originates from 
                    the Khenti mountain range in Mongolia . The catchment area is 94,010 km².
                    Heading northeast, it will travel 298 km through Mongolia, cross the border of 
                    the Russian Federation, and cross the border of Inner Siberia . 445 km will flow 
                    through Mongolia, and a total of 818 km will flow and join the Ingoda River to 
                    form the Shilka River .
                    Genghis Khan , the founder of Great Mongolia, is said to have been born 
                    in Delung Boldog on the Onon River , and in 1206 , the Great Khuraldai to enthrone 
                    him as the Great King was also held on the banks of the Onon River.
                    The water of the Onon River freezes from the end of October and freezes in the second 
                    half of November, and is covered with ice for 150-170 days. The average ice thickness 
                    reaches 1.2-1.5 m. As it is a fast-flowing mountain river, the autumn tide lasts 
                    for relatively long days (14-25). As soon as it warms up in 4 months, the ice in 
                    the river will melt and the snow in the mountains will melt and the spring flood will 
                    come, so it won't last long.
                    The Onon - Shilka - Khar River ranks among the top 10 in the world in terms of length 
                    (818km + 560km + 2874km).
                    The Onon River is a mountain river, so it has a high fall and a fast flow. In some places,
                    the current speed will reach 1.5-2.0 m/s, but it will decrease to about 1.0 m/s below 
                    the Balj estuary.
                    Agats, Balj, Eg, Barkh and Jargalant rivers, major tributaries of the Onon River, 
                    flow through mountainous terrain with steep slopes.
                    Groundwater resources consist of precipitation infiltration, seasonal and perennial 
                    permafrost, and surface water recharge.
                    The basin of the Onon River is dominated by weakly developed brown soil without mountain 
                    carbonates, and dark brown and brown soils of the river bed. Therefore, in irrigated 
                    crops, the phenomenon of salinization will be relatively low, and the presence of 
                    gypsum in some places has a good effect of neutralizing the soil. In the Onon river 
                    basin, 425 ha of land has been salted and swamped to some extent.
                    The soil in the Onon river basin is usually light loamy with a mechanical composition 
                    that is not dense, which will reduce the effort required to cultivate the soil in 
                    agriculture, but it has poor water holding capacity due to the high content of small 
                    pebbles and rocks. In terms of geography, the main groundwater storage formations 
                    are river valleys, confluence deltas, flood plains, and widened areas in river valleys.
                    is concave. Among them are the Arangat Valley, the confluence of the Onon and Khurkh 
                    Rivers, the valley between Great and Baga White Lakes, Balj, located in the northwest 
                    of Batshireet Sum.
                    The confluence valleys of the Galati and Tengele rivers are included. The absolute 
                    height of depressions, valleys, plains, and pipes is between 850-1200 m or is generally 
                    sedentary.
                    Water pollution from the Russian Federation enters the Khomel River and affects 
                    the water quality of the Onon River.</h2>

                <h2>Tuul River</h2>
                <h3>The Tuul River is a river that flows through the central and northern part of Mongolia. 
                    It has a length of 819 km and a catchment area of ​​49,840 km2. It will flow through Khentii, 
                    Central, Selenge provinces and Ulaanbaatar city. The elevation of the basin ranges from 
                    770 to 2800 meters, and the highest point is Asralt Khairkhan mountain, which is 2799.3 
                    meters above sea level, and the lowest point is the Orkhon-Tuul delta, which is 770 meters
                    above sea level. The depth is 0.8-3.5.
                    Khagi Black Lake and Noming River, which are part of the Gorkhi-Terelj Natural Complex 
                    in the Khenti Range, originate from the Noming River, flow through the southern part of 
                    the capital Ulaanbaatar, and flow into the Orkhon River. It freezes from the middle of 
                    November to the middle of April.
                    The Tuul river basin covers the territory of 37 districts of 5 provinces and 7 districts 
                    of Ulaanbaatar city, occupying a total area of ​​49774.3 km2. Tuul river basin covers 
                    65.5 percent of Ulaanbaatar city, 39.8 percent of Central province, 20.8 percent of 
                    Bulgan province, 6.0 percent of Ovorhangai province, 4.4 percent of Arkhangai province, 
                    and 2.2 percent of Selenge province.</h3>

                <h2>Kherlen River</h2>
                <h3>It is called Kherlen from the confluence of the Bogd River and the Tsagaan River, 
                    which originates at an altitude of 1,250 meters on the side of the Ikh Khentei mountain 
                    range. The length of the Kherlen River is 1264 km, and it stretches 1090 km from 
                    the confluence of the two rivers to the state border. The catchment area of ​​the river 
                    is 116,455 km, and it alone makes up 54% of the water basin of the Pacific Ocean. 
                    The Kherlen River flows in the south direction at the beginning and gradually flows 
                    back to the east in Dalai Lake, which is located across the border. The river valley 
                    is 0.5-0.7 km at the beginning, and it widens to 15-20 km as it goes down from the 
                    mountains. The width of the river is 30-50 m at the beginning, 150-200 m at the end, 
                    the depth is 1-1.5 m at the beginning, and the flow speed is 0.7-1.5 m/s. 58-64% of 
                    the Kherlen River's water supply is rainwater, 28-34% is groundwater, and 8-11% is 
                    water from melted snow.</h4>
